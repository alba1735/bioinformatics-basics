# Exploring the data

Go back to the Genome Browser. You should see a small line for your new track at the top. It might have no data in it - this is because you need to zoom out to search for SNPs part of this 3 way intersection. Scroll down and turn on the SNPedia track (or just ctrl+F). Reconfigure your browser settings so that you can see a few tracks at once. To do this, right click on the gray bar on the left side and adjust the view settings to "dense" when a track gets too large. You can also do this down below where all the tracks are listed. I recommend setting the raw custom track data (SNPs) to "dense" and the first intersection (genes and SNPs) to "hide". Drag the SNPedia tracks to the top via the gray bar. What will actually help quite a bit is if you turn off one of the SNPedia tracks by clicking on its gray bar and unchecking the "SNPedia all" box, then hitting "submit":

Navigate to the range `chr1:11,000,000-12,000,000`. You can do this by typing it into the search bar. After all of that, here's what my screen looks like.

Zoom in on the last SNP in this screen within the three-way intersection track. You can do this by shift clicking + dragging on the window. Make the viewing window less than 2000 bp. Click on the actual text and line for this SNP **within the SNPedia track**. In other words, click on the text `rs632793`. It should take you to the page detail, which looks like this:

Click on the Link to SNPedia page and read more about this SNP.
* Does this correspond to a common genotype?

Now find the another SNP within the three-way intersection track.
* Click back on the browser or reinput `chr1:11,000,000-12,000,000` into the bar.
* Does this correspond to a common genotype?
