# Custom tracks

## What makes Luke Skywalker so strong with the Force?

Here, we're going to look at a panel of Luke Skywalker's SNPs to see if there's a genetic basis for his being strong with the Force.

## Upload a custom track
To do this, we'll upload a custom track to the genome. Go to the genome browser, and reset all tracks to the default view (go to View -> Reset All User Settings).
* Make sure you are on hg19 and not hg38!
* It should look somewhat like this:

Click on My Data -> Custom Tracks.

Paste this URL into the upload section: `https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~blin/pub/bme110-w18/Luke.pgSnp`. Here is a successful track upload.

Click "Go", and zoom out to a 200 kb region. You should be able to now see the SNPs loaded in under a track titled "SNP data for Luke Skywalker".
