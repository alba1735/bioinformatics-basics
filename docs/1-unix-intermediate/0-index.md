# UNIX - Intermediate

Introduction to intermediate usage of UNIX geared for bioinformatics. Some tools are very specific and do one specific task very well and very efficiently (e.g., `grep` and `sort`). Other tools are more like pipelines in that they combine a lot of tasks together to do a larger task. You won't learn how to program per se, but you will learn how to use basic tools, become more comfortable with specialized tools and pipelines, and understand why we use these more specialized tools.
